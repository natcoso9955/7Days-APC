**7days-APC** (7 Days Afterlife Prerequisite Checker) is a utility designed to help Linux users prepare their systems to run the **Afterlife** mod for the game *7 Days to Die*. This script automates the process of installing the required dependency, `libgdiplus`, which is essential for the mod to function properly on Linux.

The project provides an evolving resource for Linux (and potentially Windows) users who prefer running mods without relying on third-party launchers.
