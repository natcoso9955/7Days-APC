# 7days-APC: 7 Days Afterlife Prerequisite Checker

**7days-APC** (7 Days Afterlife Prerequisite Checker) is a utility designed to help Linux users prepare their systems to run the **Afterlife** mod for the game *7 Days to Die*. This script automates the process of installing the required dependency, `libgdiplus`, which is essential for the mod to function properly on Linux.

The project aims to provide a centralized, evolving resource for Linux (and potentially Windows) users who prefer running mods without relying on third-party launchers. As new challenges arise, this project will grow to address them.

## Features

- **Automatic Dependency Installation**: Detects your package manager, then installs `libgdiplus`.
- **Manual Installation Instructions**: Includes detailed commands for users who prefer a manual setup.
- **Error Handling**: Provides meaningful error messages and guidance if the script cannot install the library.
- **Expandable**: Designed with scalability in mind, allowing for future additions such as mod auto-updaters and dependency management.

## Manual Installation

If you prefer to install `libgdiplus` manually or the script is unable to do so, follow the steps below based on your distribution.

### Step 1: Update Your Package Manager
Always ensure your package manager is up to date:
- **Debian/Ubuntu**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  ```
- **CentOS/RHEL**:
  ```bash
  sudo yum update
  ```
- **Fedora**:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf update
  ```
- **Arch Linux**:
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -Syu
  ```

### Step 2: Install `libgdiplus`
Use the appropriate command for your system:
- **Debian/Ubuntu**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install -y libgdiplus
  ```
- **CentOS/RHEL**:
  ```bash
  sudo yum install -y libgdiplus
  ```
- **Fedora**:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install -y libgdiplus
  ```
- **Arch Linux**:
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -Sy libgdiplus
  ```

### Step 3: Verify Installation
To confirm the library is installed:
```bash
ldconfig -p | grep libgdiplus
```
If `libgdiplus` appears in the output, the installation was successful.
